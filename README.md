# create-a-ton
36 hours IMA Low Res challenge.

## About
For our create-athon, we designed a website with a p5.js sketch. The sketch uses a video delay script + posenet to create a head tracker. If the user moves their body really face they can create a wave pattern. When they hit a mouse click, they are able to take a screenshot of their sketch.
